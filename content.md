    Hi there! I'm an MS student at <strong>FAST NUCES</strong> <img src="images/FAST-NU-logo.png" alt="FAST Logo" style="height:1em; vertical-align:middle;">, Department of Data Science, advised by <strong><a href="https://khi.nu.edu.pk/personnel/dr-muhammad-rafi-phd/" style="color: DarkSlateBlue;">Dr. Rafi</a></strong>. I obtained my B.E. degree from the <strong>School of Engineering, NED University</strong> <img src="images/logo_300x200.png" alt="NED Logo" style="height:1em; vertical-align:middle;">. Currently, I am working as a Teaching Assistant at FAST NUCES for the course of <strong>Advanced Computer Vision</strong> for post-grad level under the guidance of <strong><a href="https://khi.nu.edu.pk/personnel/dr-maria-siddiqua-phd/" style="color: DarkSlateBlue;">Dr. Maria </a></strong> also worked as a Data Scientist at <strong>GSK</strong> <img src="images/GSK.png" alt="GSK Logo" style="height:1em; vertical-align:middle;"> for their global supply chain tech department building computer vision solutions.  

    My research interests lie in developing reliable machine learning algorithms and uncertainty quantification for risk-aware decision-making in computer vision and natural language processing frameworks for real-world applications with a particular focus on the alignment of Large Foundation Models (LLMs and VLMs).
